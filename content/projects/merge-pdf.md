Developed a web-based tool using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js that allows users to upload and merge multiple PDF files into a single document. The application features a drag-and-drop interface, real-time file preview, and a progress indicator for uploads. Server-side PDF processing is handled using pdf-lib and multer for efficient file handling. Implemented role-based access control and ensured secure file storage and deletion. Designed for ease of use with a responsive UI and intuitive workflow.
